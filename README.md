#MarkovProcesses
The program shall implement the value iteration algorithm for finding the optimal policy for
each state of an MDP using Bellmanâ€™s equation. After each of the first 20 iterations of the value 
iteration algorithm,your program should print to stdout the J value and the optimal policy for each 
state of the given MDP.
